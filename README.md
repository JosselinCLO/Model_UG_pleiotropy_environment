The repository is for the simulation code of the manuscript: How environment and genetic architecture of unreduced gametes shape the establishment of autopolyploids, by Cheng et al. (2024). The manuscript is available on Biorxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.13.612821v1).

It contains the annotated Rcode to perform or replicate the simulations.

We developed a theoretical model in which we modeled the joint evolution of a quantitative trait under selection and the production of unreduced gametes, this trait also being a quantitative trait; both traits were pleiotropically linked. We followed the adaptation of initially diploid populations to a new environment to which neo-tetraploid individuals were directly adapted. The generation of these autotetraploid individuals was enabled by the genetic production of unreduced gametes and by the environmental change modifying the average production of these gametes.
